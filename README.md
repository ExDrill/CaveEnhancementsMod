# Cave Enhancements!

## Description

Cave Enhancements is a mod for Fabric that expands upon the Caves and Cliffs update by adding new exciting utility items, mobs, blocks, biomes, etc.

## Other

We won't backport to a specific version.

There aren't any plans for a forge port at the moment.


## For those on 1.18!
This mod needs [GeckoLib](https://github.com/bernie-g/geckolib) and [Terrablender](https://github.com/Glitchfiend/TerraBlender) to function properly!
1.18 support is finished, please do not ask for updates on 1.18 :)

Otherwise, you won't need anything as of now.
