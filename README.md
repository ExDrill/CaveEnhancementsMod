# Cave Enhancements!

## Setup

Cave Enhancements is a mod for Fabric that expands upon the Caves and Cliffs update by adding new exciting utility items, mobs, blocks, biomes, etc.

This mod needs [Terrablender](https://github.com/Glitchfiend/TerraBlender) and [GeckoLib](https://github.com/bernie-g/geckolib) to function properly!

There are no current plans for a Forge port, please do not ask :)
