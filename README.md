# Cave Enhancements!

## Description

Cave Enhancements is a mod for Fabric that expands upon the Caves and Cliffs update by adding new exciting utility items, mobs, blocks, biomes, etc.

## Other

This mod needs [GeckoLib](https://github.com/bernie-g/geckolib) to function properly!

Currently, there aren't any plans for:

- A forge port

- A 1.18.1 port

So please, do not ask :)
